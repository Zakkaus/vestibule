# Outage and recovery

The recovery mechanism protects applicants from deadlines consumed while the bot cannot reach Telegram. It does not pause wall-clock timers globally; each expiry checks reachability before settlement.

## Heartbeat and outage detection

**Implementation:** package `internal/verify`, `(*Service).RunHeartbeat`, `(*Service).heartbeatTick`, and `(*Service).offlineNow` in `internal/verify/state.go`; package `main`, `main` in `cmd/vestibule/main.go`.

The process starts one heartbeat goroutine. Its first probe occurs after 25 seconds and repeats every 25 seconds. Each `GetMe` probe has a ten-second context. Successful probes update `lastOnline` and best-effort persist `heartbeat.json`. Failed probes log that verification timeouts are paused and leave `lastOnline` unchanged.

More than 70 seconds since confirmed contact marks the service offline. More than 90 seconds between successful probes makes the next success a recovery event. These thresholds differ deliberately: an expiry also performs a fresh probe, so it can detect an outage before the heartbeat’s stale-contact threshold.

Heartbeat write failure does not stop probing and is not surfaced beyond the shared store log. Cancellation stops the loop without another probe.

## Expiry while Telegram is unreachable

**Implementation:** package `internal/verify`, `(*Service).onExpiry`, `(*Service).reachable`, and `(*Service).deferExpiry` in `internal/verify/state.go`.

When a pending timer fires, `onExpiry` first checks stale heartbeat state and then, when needed, performs a fresh ten-second `GetMe` probe. If either says Telegram is unreachable, the pending request is not consumed, declined, or struck. The first unreachable expiry records `deferred_since` in `pending.json`; restarts and recovery windows retain that timestamp.

Before the cap, `deferExpiry` uses the normal expiry delay but never arms a deadline later than 48 hours after `deferred_since`. The original reason is retained, so an ordinary timeout that fires online before the cap can still strike. The 48-hour limit is a named constant, not a configuration setting.

At the cap, the bot persists a one-time marker and logs a warning naming the group and applicant. Once Telegram is reachable, it declines the request without a strike, cooldown, or ban, deletes both challenge messages independently, and sends the localized reapply notice. If Telegram remains unreachable or rejects the decline call, settlement retries every 60 seconds instead of granting another full verification window.

Every timer captures the pending nonce and an incrementing epoch. A stale timer from a replaced request, previous deadline, or recovery cannot settle the current pending record. Failure of the expiry-time probe is enough to defer; no operator action is required.

## Runtime recovery and re-notification

**Implementation:** package `internal/verify`, `(*Service).onRecovery` and `(*Service).renotifyPending` in `internal/verify/state.go`.

After more than 90 seconds without successful contact, the next successful heartbeat grants each live pending request a new strike-free deadline. A request already in deferral receives a full window only when that deadline stays within its 48-hour cap. A request at the cap keeps a 60-second settlement retry and is not re-notified.

At most 30 applicants per recovery are re-notified. Each receives a DM outage notice, followed by replacement delivery through the same `delivery_mode` path used for a new request: `group` posts in the group, `dm` attempts private delivery with definite-rejection fallback, and `both` posts in the group and attempts private delivery. In `both`, each selected applicant therefore causes three sequential message sends including the outage notice; the cap still counts applicants. Additional pendings receive the refreshed deadline silently.

A pending re-notified within its own timeout window is not messaged again during flapping, although its deadline is refreshed within the deferral cap. Recovery is suppressed after graceful shutdown begins.

The old challenges remain recorded when no replacement delivery is confirmed. After any replacement delivery is confirmed, the current group message ID is replaced, the private message ID changes only after confirmed private delivery, and both old message IDs are deleted through independent best-effort calls. A failed delete does not prevent the other.

After re-notification, pending state is saved so new deadlines and both replacement message IDs survive another crash. Save failure leaves the fresh state only in memory.

## Restart recovery

**Implementation:** package `internal/verify`, `(*Service).load` and `(*Service).loadHeartbeat` in `internal/verify/state.go`; package `internal/verify`, `New` in `internal/verify/service.go`.

Construction loads `pending.json` and uses the last successful timestamp in `heartbeat.json` to estimate downtime. It restores only records for groups present in the startup effective config. Invalid or unwinnable quiz payloads are skipped. Kernel attempts, fallback state, one-shot guards, nonce, language, question, deadline, both message IDs, `deferred_since`, and the one-time cap marker are retained. Older records without the deferral fields remain loadable.

If estimated downtime exceeds 90 seconds, each restored pending receives a fresh strike-free window that cannot pass its existing 48-hour deferral cap. Up to 30 are re-notified through their delivery modes, and the adjusted state is saved. A request already at the cap instead receives a 60-second settlement retry and no re-notification. If downtime is shorter, a future deadline keeps its remaining duration. A deadline that elapsed during the short restart receives a 60-second strike-free `restart-lapsed` window.

The short-restart 60-second adjustment is not immediately saved by `load`. If the process crashes again before another pending-state save, the next restart can calculate the grace again from the old deadline. Missing, corrupt, or unreadable heartbeat state yields no downtime estimate, so long-outage restart recovery is not selected. The pending records still follow their stored deadlines, deferral cap, and short-restart rules.

An unreadable `pending.json` leaves the file untouched, disables pending writes for this process, and restores nothing. Corrupt JSON is moved to `.corrupt` when possible, restores nothing, and leaves the path available for later fresh saves.

## Shutdown and process-level failure

**Implementation:** package `internal/verify`, `(*Service).Shutdown` in `internal/verify/service.go`; package `main`, `streamEndedUnexpectedly` and `main` in `cmd/vestibule/main.go`.

On signal-driven shutdown, long polling stops first and the handler drains every update already fetched into Telego before it stops. `Shutdown` then marks verification as shutting down, stops every timer, refuses later settlement claims, and saves pending, strike, and heartbeat state. A timer racing shutdown therefore cannot decline, strike, or ban an applicant after the freeze.

Long polling is configured to retry transient polling errors every five seconds. If the update stream ends while the process context is still live, the process exits nonzero for systemd restart. Fatal paths do not execute graceful deferred cleanup. They rely on per-event atomic saves and the previously persisted heartbeat; an in-flight mutation whose save had not completed can be absent after restart.
