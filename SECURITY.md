# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest released version (and the `main` branch) receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue for an
unpatched vulnerability.

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Zakkaus/vestibule/security/advisories/new)
(the repo's **Security → Report a vulnerability**), or contact the maintainer
[@Zakkaus](https://github.com/Zakkaus) directly.

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is ready it will be
released and your report credited, unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

## Operator notes

- The bot token (`BOT_TOKEN`) and optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` come from the environment only.
  Keep `bot.env` at mode `0600` and never commit it; `config.json` holds no secrets. Do not put a
  real token in `printf`, `echo`, `install`, or another command argument: interactive shells may
  preserve that argument in history even when the destination file is private. Create an empty
  `0600` file and edit it with `sudoedit`, as shown in the README.
- Admin and moderation commands are gated on Telegram group-admin status and **fail
  closed** on API errors; callback buttons verify the acting user. Only run the bot
  in groups whose admin set you trust.
- The bot uses long polling and needs no inbound network port.
- The `$STATE_DIRECTORY` holds runtime state (pending verifications, strikes, feed cursors). It must
  be **private to the bot's service user** and not writable by untrusted users; the provided systemd
  unit's `StateDirectory=` + `DynamicUser=` already enforce this.
- With no owner bound, startup logs an `OWNER UNCLAIMED` one-use claim link. Until that link is
  used, **anyone who can read the journal, including a central log collector, can become the bot
  owner**. The link expires after 10 minutes by default; set `owner_claim_lifetime_seconds` to
  shorten or extend that window. Set the optional `owner_claim_user_id` to restrict the claim to
  one Telegram user while retaining zero-touch setup when the key is absent.

## Static analysis (gosec)

CI runs `gosec` and **fails on any new finding outside the accepted classes below**. These classes
are accepted by design under the intended private-`StateDirectory=` systemd deployment and are
excluded in CI (`-exclude=G304,G703,G706`):

| Rule | Where | Why accepted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **G304 / G703** — file path from a variable | state-file reads/writes and config load (`internal/store/json.go`, `internal/feed/feed.go`, `cmd/bot/main.go`, `internal/config/config.go`) | Paths come from the operator CLI (`--config`) or systemd `$STATE_DIRECTORY`, never from a Telegram user; the unit confines filesystem access. |
| **G706** — log taint | `log.Printf` of usernames, chat titles, and paths across `internal/verify`, `internal/feed`, and `internal/app` | Values are operator config or Telegram-supplied display strings written to journald (not a fragile log parser); no command/format injection. |

Any other gosec rule — or a path/log finding that ever reaches genuinely untrusted input — fails CI.
